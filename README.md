# GNI Linear Regression Model
Project to create a data set,clean the data, create a statistical model, make recommendations.
This project analyzes the relationship between the number of deaths worldwide due to leading risk factors and the financial prosperity of these countries, as measured by their Gross National Income per capita. After collecting, cleaning, and merging the data a model is built using forward selection stepwise regression. The resulting model has an Adjusted R-squared value of .676. For a simple linear model without higher order terms, this is a good starting point for crafting a more comprehensive model.

GNI-Death Risk Project.docx is the report on this project. It describes the data aquisition, cleaning, merging of data, the model building, and model validation.
GNI-vs-deathrate.ipynb is a deepnote python notebook with the code used to clean and merge data, build the model, and validate the model.
number-of-deaths-by-risk-factor.csv, API_NY.GNP.PCAP.CD_DS2_en_csv_v2, and API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2 are the three data sources for this project
